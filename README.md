# RNN-Based-Question-Answering
This project demonstrates a basic Question Answering (QA) system using PyTorch. The model is built on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture and is trained to answer questions based on a provided context. The system works by identifying and answering only those questions that have been seen during the training process.

This project serves as an introduction to:

1. Building simple RNN-based QA systems

2. Understanding sequence modeling in NLP tasks

3. The limitation of models in closed-domain tasks where the system answers only seen questions
